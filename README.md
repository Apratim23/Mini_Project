# 🌱 Micro Mandi Platform

A digital platform designed to bridge the gap between small-scale farmers and local consumers, enabling direct transactions and reducing reliance on middlemen.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Small farmers often struggle to sell their produce due to:

- High transportation costs to distant markets.
- Lack of awareness about direct selling methods.
- Reliance on middlemen, leading to reduced profits.
- Food wastage due to the inability to reach consumers in time.

On the other hand, local consumers and businesses face challenges in sourcing fresh farm produce directly from farmers.

## ✅ Our Solution

**Micro Mandi** is a **digital marketplace** that connects small farmers with local buyers, including households, grocery stores, and restaurants. It enables:

- **Easy Listing:** Farmers can enter details of their produce (type, quantity, price).
- **Direct Purchase:** Consumers can view available produce and place orders.
- **Collection Points:** A village-based micro mandi serves as a pick-up hub.
- **Fair Pricing:** Farmers receive direct payments, eliminating middlemen.
- **Reduced Food Miles:** Fresh produce reaches consumers faster, ensuring quality.

## 📖 How It Works (Example)

Ramesh, a small farmer, struggled to sell his vegetables due to high transport costs. Upon joining Micro Mandi, he listed his produce, which was quickly bought by a local store and a restaurant. Instead of traveling 30 km, Ramesh deposited his goods at the nearby collection point, where buyers picked them up. This reduced costs, improved profits, and ensured fresh produce for consumers.
